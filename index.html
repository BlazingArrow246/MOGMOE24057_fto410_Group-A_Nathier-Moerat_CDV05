                <h3>Agile Task Management AppüñäÔ∏è</h3>
                <p> In this project, I developed an Agile Task Management App designed to streamline task organization and tracking. The app incorporates essential features to enhance user productivity and adaptability:
                    
                    Show/Hide Sidebar: Implemented a toggleable sidebar to provide users with a clean and customizable workspace, allowing for seamless navigation and task management.
                    
                    Light/Dark Theme Toggle: Added functionality for switching between light and dark themes to improve user accessibility and enhance visual comfort, catering to diverse user preferences.
                    
                    Task Management Features: Designed interactive buttons for adding, editing, and deleting tasks. These actions are integral to maintaining an up-to-date task list tailored to user needs.
                    
                    Task Categorization: Developed sections for organizing tasks into "To Be Done," "Doing," and "Done" categories, supporting Agile workflows and enabling clear visualization of progress.
                    
                    This project strengthened my skills in building responsive, user-friendly interfaces while integrating dynamic functionalities. It also emphasized the importance of user-centered design principles and Agile methodologies in software development.</p>
